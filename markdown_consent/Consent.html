        You are about to participate in a research experiment run by a professor, Kristian Lopez Vargas, and a graduate
        student, Cliff Nelson, who are affiliated with UC Santa Cruz. The purpose of the research is to investigate the
        effect that past changes in fundamental value have on the price people are willing to pay for an asset. If you
        participate, you will be given directions and then quizzed to make sure you understand these directions. Then
        you will be asked some questions about your thoughts on certain assets that will be shown to you. In total this
        experiment is expected to take no more than 1 hour. Participation is voluntary and you can choose not to
        participate at any time. You will be compensated for your participation.  At minimum, you will receive the
        $4 for each 15 minutes of your participation, but you can receive more depending on your performance in the
        experiment. If you decide not to participate, you will receive $7 for showing up and are free to leave.
        However, we hope that you will participate and that you will find this to be an enjoyable experience.
